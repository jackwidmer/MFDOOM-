    <p class="aboutText">One of hip-hop's most beloved anti-heroes, the ever-inventive MF Doom (often referred to as simply DOOM, in all caps) received widespread praise for his sharp, candid rhymes as well as his choppy, sample-heavy production style. Initially known as Zev Love X, a member of the short-lived but influential Golden Age rap group K.M.D., the MC/producer born Daniel Dumile re-emerged at the end of the '90s with a persona and logo patterned after the Marvel Comics super villain Dr. Doom. He reinforced his enigmatic persona by donning an elaborate iron mask during all of his public appearances, in addition to occasionally hiring stand-ins for his performances. Only a handful of proper full-lengths were credited to his best-known moniker, including Operation: Doomsday (1999), Mm..Food (2004), and Born Like This (2009), yet his discography was extensive, filled with numerous collaborations -- most notably Madvillainy, made with Madlib, plus albums with Danger Mouse and Czarface -- as well as instrumental albums and works by alter egos. A heavily influential figure in underground hip-hop, Doom was best known to mainstream audiences through his collaborations with virtual pop group Gorillaz as well as exposure on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block.</p>
